It was during his final year that he delved into the world of web development, channelling his skills to create a vibrant website for a local childrens rugby club. Since then, Joe has been weaving his coding magic, turning ideas into seamless digital experiences. Beyond the digital realm, Joe has a soft spot for the finer things in life — especially cheese.</p>

  <p className="pt-5 pb-10">Id been freelancing all the way through University and in the final year I knew I didn&apos;t want this to change — I didnt want to work for anybody else, I wanted to pursue my own goals and build my own thing. This is when I got put in touch with Andy who was looking for a developer for the work he was doing for his freelance clients (due to his Macromedia Flash skills no longer being valid!), and it all boomed from there. I developed websites whilst he designed them. Then we decided it would just be better if we merged… So sat in my Dads house, we came up with the name Shape, the rest is history.</p>

  <p className="pt-5 pb-10">Like most people you never end up with your “dream job” do you? Up until nearly school leaving age I wanted to do a more physically demanding job… a fireman! I used to be obsessed with anything fire-related (I wasn’t an arsonist!) But because of a lack of physical fitness and a new interest in design, I never pursued that career.</p>
